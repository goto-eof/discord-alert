# Discord Alert

I took an old component that I have implemented in the past and improved it. This is a contact form that, on form submission,  sends a message on a Discord channel. The application has been implemented with React (TypeScript) and ChakraUI. You can see a demo (old version) on my [website](http://andre-i.eu#contactme).

# Configuration

Create a file named `.env` and add your Discord channel url.
```
REACT_APP_DISCORD_URI=https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks...
```

# Run the project 

```
yarn start
```

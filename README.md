# Discord Alert

I took an old component that I have implemented in the past and improved it. This is a contact form that sends on form submission a message on a Discord channel. The application has been implemented with React (TypeScript) and ChakraUI. You can see a demo (old version) on my (website)[http://andre-i.eu].

# Run the project 

```
yarn start
```
